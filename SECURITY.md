Security Policy for Word Puzzle - Foxxy Sushi Games

Effective Date: [8/2/2025]

1. Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for Word Puzzle by Foxxy Sushi Games. This Security Policy outlines the best practices and guidelines to ensure the security of this repository, including code contributions, vulnerabilities, and data protection.

We are committed to maintaining a secure and transparent environment for developers, contributors, and users of this repository. This policy applies to all code, issues, pull requests, and interactions within the repository.

2. Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in the repository, we ask that you follow these steps to responsibly disclose it:

Do not create public issues or pull requests about the security vulnerability.
Email the maintainers of the repository at [security@foxxysushigames.com] with details about the vulnerability.
Include a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and any potential fixes or mitigations.
Upon receiving your report, the maintainers will evaluate the issue and work on a resolution.
Once resolved, we will notify the community with an updated release or patch notes, detailing the vulnerability and how it was addressed.

3. Secure Coding Practices

To maintain the security and integrity of the Word Puzzle project, all contributors are expected to adhere to the following guidelines:

Avoid hardcoding sensitive information: Never store passwords, API keys, or private tokens directly in the code. Use environment variables or secure vaults for storing sensitive information.
Use proper input validation: Ensure that user inputs are validated, sanitized, and properly escaped to prevent issues such as SQL injection or code injection.
Code review: Every pull request should undergo a thorough code review by at least one other contributor to catch potential security flaws and bugs.
Use secure libraries: Always ensure that external libraries and dependencies used in the project are secure and up to date. Avoid using deprecated libraries with known vulnerabilities.

4. Repository Access Control

Access to the repository should be controlled and monitored. Only authorized collaborators are allowed to make changes to the main branch. Here are the practices to follow:

Granting access: Access to the repository should only be granted to trusted contributors. Use GitHub’s built-in permissions system to manage access levels (read, write, admin).
Branch protection: Enable branch protection rules for the main branch (or other primary branches) to ensure that only approved changes are merged.
Pull request checks: Configure the repository to require a successful build or continuous integration (CI) check before allowing pull requests to be merged.

5. Secure Dependencies

Track dependencies: Use tools such as npm audit, yarn audit, or pip-audit (depending on your tech stack) to regularly scan for vulnerabilities in the project’s dependencies.
Update dependencies: Always update libraries and dependencies to the latest stable versions. Regularly check for security patches and updates.
Use a lock file: Commit lock files (e.g., package-lock.json, yarn.lock, Pipfile.lock) to the repository to ensure that the specific versions of dependencies are used across all environments.

6. Protecting User Data

If your game involves handling any personal user data or user-generated content through the repository (e.g., through API calls, analytics, or storage), ensure the following:

Avoid storing sensitive data: Do not store sensitive user information such as passwords, credit card details, or personally identifiable information (PII) in the repository.
Data encryption: If the game involves transmitting sensitive information (e.g., account details), ensure that data is encrypted using protocols like TLS/SSL.
Privacy practices: Ensure compliance with privacy regulations such as GDPR or CCPA for any user data processed in the game.

7. Code of Conduct for Contributors

In order to maintain a secure and friendly environment, all contributors are expected to follow the repository's Code of Conduct. This includes:

Treating other contributors with respect and professionalism.
Avoiding inappropriate behavior, including harassment and disruptive actions.
Ensuring that all communications within the repository (issues, comments, pull requests) remain constructive and positive.

8. Continuous Integration and Testing

Automated testing and continuous integration (CI) pipelines are essential for detecting security issues early. The repository should include:

Unit tests: Ensure that code changes are covered by tests that validate the integrity of the game and prevent regressions.
Security testing: Implement automated security scans (e.g., dependency checks, static code analysis, vulnerability scanning) as part of the CI pipeline.
Manual security review: Periodically review the code for common security risks and vulnerabilities.

9. Regular Security Audits

Perform regular security audits on the project’s codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities or issues.
Use tools like GitHub's Dependabot to monitor and update dependencies automatically.
Engage with third-party security experts for audits when necessary.

10. License and Third-Party Tools

Ensure that all code and assets in the repository comply with the chosen open-source license. If third-party tools or assets are used, ensure they are properly licensed, and any license obligations are followed.

LICENSE file: The repository should include a clear and appropriate open-source license (e.g., MIT, GPL, etc.).
Attribution for third-party assets: All third-party libraries or assets should be properly attributed according to their respective licenses.

11. Conclusion

Security is a top priority for Foxxy Sushi Games and the Word Puzzle project. We appreciate the contributions of the open-source community and encourage responsible, security-conscious behavior. By adhering to this policy, you can help ensure that Word Puzzle remains a secure and enjoyable game for everyone.
